# uci-census-income-classification
This report compares the performance of three classification models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifiers, and Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of these models in classifying outcomes when applied to a real-world dataset like the UCI census income dataset. The UCI dataset, consisting of approximately 32,000 records and 14 attributes, was selected for its multivariate data such as the categorical (e.g., occupation, education) and numerical (e.g., age, hours-per-week) features. The classification task is to determine if an individualâ€™s annual income is greater than $50,000 or less than or equal to $ 50,000.
